### Hello I'm David ðŸ‘‹ A Front End Developer from London.
#### I work at Access as a Snr Front End Developer. For more information about me, check out davidrich.es


I enjoy working closely with creative teams, brainstorming ideas, finding simple solutions to design challenges and bringing them to life. I'm easy to get on with, social and a team player.

Outside of work, I love sport and can regularly be found playing hockey & cricket as well as occasionally attempting to swing a golf club.
